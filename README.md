# AlgosPractice
Algorithms practice for interviews. Trying my best to do at least 2 problems a day. 

Started on February 13, 2020 while in Master's of CS @ UChicago.

Problems pulled almost exclusively from Leetcode.

**Languages Done**
* Java

**Languages Planned**
* Python
* C++

Modeled after this [absolute beast](https://github.com/calvinchankf/AlgoDaily) that I found while browsing Git

| Date           | Problem      | Type         | Notes        | 
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------: | 
|  Cell Contents | More Stuff   | And Again    | Stuff        | 
| You Can Also   | Put Pipes In | Like this \| | Stuff        |
