/*
Design an elevator system given the following specifications:
    1. There are 10 floors
    2. There are 4 elevators
    3. Each floor has both an up and down button
    4. If an elevator is idle, then it stays on the floor it is at
*/

/*
Assumptions:
    - There is a weight capacity for each elevator.
    - There is an algorithm to decide which elevator should go to which floor. For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume it is abstracted away.
        - Alternatively, we could send an upgoing elevator to all calls above it, unless there is another elevator that is closer to the upwards call. Vice versa
        for calls below the elevator.

Design:
